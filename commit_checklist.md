Here’s a “pro‑mode” pass over your PR as it stands today. Big picture: you’ve addressed the substantive correctness issues we discussed (string‑normalizing labels, precedence, negation, docs) and the tests now tell a coherent story of the feature. I’d be comfortable making this public after a few last‑mile polish items called out below.

---

## What materially improved since the last review

* **String‑normalization for expression labels**
  You now coerce non‑string values to strings in both the `label` property setter and `set_label()` for `Expression`. Tests verify numeric (and even `Path`‑like) inputs become strings. Good symmetry with `Constraint`. ([GitHub][1])

* **Operator precedence is now right**
  Division by a product is parenthesized on the RHS (e.g., `a / (b @ c)`), and division in a product gets parentheses (e.g., `(a / b) @ c`). You also fixed a Ruff E501 in the tests when documenting this and split the long condition in the operator code. ([GitHub][2])

* **Negation formatting fixed**
  `-x` no longer inserts redundant parentheses for leaf nodes; `format_labeled()` mirrors `name()` logic. ([GitHub][3])

* **Tests: breadth and intent**
  The suite now covers: property vs. method, clearing labels with `None`, non‑string labels, precedence (`a + b @ c`, `a @ (b + c)`, `(a / b) @ c` vs. `a / (b @ c)`), parameters, matrices, and a deep nesting case that doubles as a mutation/termination demo. ([GitHub][4])

* **Docs aligned with the API**
  Tutorial text now uses “labels,” demonstrates `format_labeled()` for expressions, and shows chaining with `set_label()`. The example printing behavior for constraints vs. expressions is clear. ([GitHub][5])

* **Why both a property and a method?**
  You documented that `set_label()` exists for fluent chaining while `expr.label = ...` is the simple property path. Nice—reviewers will ask, and this answers it. ([GitHub][6])

* **Housekeeping**
  Removed the legacy `test_custom_display_names.py` and various local/dev artifacts. ([GitHub][7])

## Is it “bullet‑proof”?

**Almost there.** The core behavior and the user‑facing surface look solid, and the failure‑modes you’ve chosen not to “fix” are now documented in tests and docs. I’d ship after tightening a few items that improve polish and maintainability without changing behavior.

### Ship‑blockers (small)

1. **Remove the ad‑hoc `__main__` test runner + prints from the test file.**
   The current test module still contains a manual harness (prints like “Running EDGE CASE tests…”, “✅ All tests passed!”). Even if harmless under `pytest`, it adds noise and can fail style checks (you already had to adjust f‑strings). Convert explanatory output to comments or docstrings and delete the bottom harness. Your “known limitation” test already asserts behavior, so the prints aren’t needed. ([GitHub][8])

2. **Type hints & docstrings: `Optional[str]`.**
   `set_label(self, label: str)` and the property setter both allow `None`. Update the annotations and docstrings to `Optional[str]` for clarity and IDE help. (You already do `if label is not None else None` internally.) ([GitHub][6])

### Nice‑to‑have polish (non‑blocking)

* **Tidy the tutorial example output.**
  The tutorial currently shows a string like `Objective with labels: minimize portfolio_variance + -0.1 * expected_return`. You could arrange the example to print `... - 0.1 * expected_return` (e.g., build it as `portfolio_variance - 0.1 * expected_return`) so readers don’t stumble over `+ -0.1`. ([GitHub][5])

* **Unify doc terminology across the code comments.**
  You’ve already replaced “display\_name” with “label” across the docs; do a quick sweep for stray “display\_name” mentions in code comments (looks mostly clean now). ([GitHub][5])

---

## Tests: balance of readability, coverage, concision

### What works well

* **Narrative structure.** The “CORE / EDGE CASES / OPTIONAL / KNOWN LIMITATIONS” sections make the file read like a mini‑tutorial without being verbose. ✅
* **Focused assertions.** Where formatting can vary (e.g., `Sum(x, ...)`), you assert substrings instead of exact full strings—great choice for robustness.
* **Precedence coverage.** The new tests hit exactly the tricky spots we discussed. ([GitHub][4])

### The “test with no assertion” question

You’ve addressed it: the “known limitation” test now **does** assert something concrete—e.g., that the inner component labels survive while the top‑level flattening label is lost. That’s the right way to “document” expected limitations in a test: use asserts to lock in the current behavior and include a brief comment explaining why. The extra `print(...)` lines can go (see blocker 1). ([GitHub][8])

### Tiny test improvements I’d still consider

* **Parametrize the precedence micro‑cases.**
  A `pytest.mark.parametrize` table with cases like
  `expr, expected = [(a + b @ c, "a + b @ c"), (a @ (b + c), "(b + c)"), ((a / b) @ c, "(a / b) @ c"), (a / (b @ c), "a / (b @ c)")]`
  would shave a few lines and keep the logic declarative. (No behavior change.)

* **One quick “label‑wins” invariant.**
  Add a tiny test asserting that if an expression has a label, `format_labeled()` returns it **without** recursing. You already have this implicitly; an explicit invariant test makes the rule unmistakable for future contributors.

* **Drop “OPTIONAL” if it causes CI pain.**
  The matrix/parameter tests are fine; if any are flaky across solver backends, mark them with `@pytest.mark.slow` or pare them back.

---

## API & implementation notes

* **Constraint `__str__` change is deliberate and documented.**
  `str(con)` now prefixes the label (`"label: <math>"`). This is sensible for debugging but might slightly change doctest expectations; your docs already explain the distinction between constraints and expressions (labels in `str()` for constraints, `format_labeled()` for expressions). Good. ([GitHub][9])

* **Binary operator formatting covers the right special cases.**
  You parenthesize addition and division arguments and, for division, you also parenthesize a right‑hand multiplication to preserve meaning. That matches user intuition and the algebra. ([GitHub][2])

* **Negation formatting mirrors `name()`.**
  You now avoid `-(x)` for leafs, printing `-x`. This keeps labeled output consistent with the existing, unlabeled formatting. ([GitHub][3])

---

## Final pre‑public checklist

* [ ] Remove manual test runner and the remaining `print(...)`s from `cvxpy/tests/test_labels.py`. (Leave asserts + comments.) ([GitHub][8])
* [ ] Update type hints/docstrings to `Optional[str]` for label setters. ([GitHub][6])
* [ ] (Optional) Parametrize precedence tests; add one explicit “label‑wins” invariant test. ([GitHub][4])
* [ ] (Optional) Reword the tutorial example to avoid `+ -0.1 * ...`. ([GitHub][5])

If you make those small cleanups, I think this is in great shape to go public. The core mechanics are sound, the user experience is intuitive, and the tests are readable and purposeful. Nicely done.
